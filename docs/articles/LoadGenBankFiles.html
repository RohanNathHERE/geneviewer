<p>This tutorial demonstrates creating gene cluster visualizations from
GenBank files using <code>geneviewer</code>. For guidance on importing
clusters from FASTA files see: <a href="https://nvelden.github.io/geneviewer/articles/LoadFastaFiles.html" class="external-link">link</a>.
You can obtain GenBank files containing genomic data from a variety of
platforms such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" class="external-link">NCBI</a>, <a href="https://www.ensembl.org/" class="external-link">Ensembl</a>, <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/" class="external-link">UCSC</a>, <a href="https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/#!/start" class="external-link">antiSMASH</a>
and <a href="https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/" class="external-link">MIBiG</a>. While
<code>geneviewer</code> is designed to handle GenBank files from these
sources (please report any compatibility issues on <a href="https://github.com/nvelden/geneviewer/issues" class="external-link">Github</a>), this
tutorial specifically aims to replicate a gene cluster visualization
found on the <a href="https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/" class="external-link">MIBiG</a>
website.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="materials">Materials<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#materials"></a>
</h3>
<p>The .gbk files can be downloaded from the <a href="https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/" class="external-link">MIBiG</a> website
following the below instructions or directly from the <a href="https://github.com/nvelden/geneviewer-tutorials/tree/main/Loading%20GenBank%20files" class="external-link">geneviewer-tutorials</a>
repository.</p>

</h3>
<p>The GenBank files from <a href="https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/" class="external-link">MIBiG</a> include
additional details, enabling us to color-code genes by function, which
we will use to reproduce the visualizations they show on the website.
Begin by downloading a GenBank file from the <a href="https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/" class="external-link">MIBiG</a> website. For
the below tutorial we will use the genbank file for gene cluster <a href="https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/repository/BGC0000001/index.html#r1c1" class="external-link">BGC0000001</a>.
Simply click the “Download GenBank file” link and save the file.</p>
<p>We can load the file into R using the <code>read_gbk</code> function
from <code>geneviewer</code>. This will create a list containing all the
sections and features found in the GenBank file.</p>

<p>We can inspect the .gbk using the View pane in Rstudio (use
<code>View(gbk)</code>) or by simply opening the .gbk file in a text
editor. For the visualization we are interested in the start and end
position of each gene as well as their identifiers and functions. We can
find these under FEATURES &gt; CDS. Lets print the first CDS to see what
information it contains.</p>

<p>We can bind the information of each CDS into a data.frame using the
<code>gbk_features_to_df</code> function. In the below code we define
the feature and the keys we are interested in and bind it into a
data.frame. We set process_region to <code>TRUE</code> which will
extract the strand, start and end from the region key.</p>

<p>The above functions to read and transfom .gbk files can also be used
to load multiple .gbk files from a folder and shown the clusters side by
side. To demonstrate this we can go to the cluster page for <a href="https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/repository/BGC0000001/index.html#r1c1" class="external-link">BGC0000001</a>
and navigate to the “KnownClusterBlast” page. Click on the homologous
clusters and download the .gbk files for <a href="https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/repository/BGC0001694/index.html#r1c1" class="external-link">BGC0001694</a>,
