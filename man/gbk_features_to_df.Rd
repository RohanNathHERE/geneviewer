\title{Convert GeneBank Features to Data Frame}
\usage{
gbk_features_to_df(
  gbk_list,
  feature = "CDS",
  keys = NULL,
  process_region = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gbk_list}{A list of lists where each sub-list contains GeneBank features
for a specific gene cluster. Each sub-list is expected to have a named list
of features, with each feature being a character vector.}

\item{feature}{A string specifying the feature type to extract from each gene cluster's
FEATURE list (e.g., "CDS" or "gene"). Defaults to "CDS".}

\item{keys}{An optional vector of strings representing specific keys within the
feature to retain in the final data frame. If `NULL` (the default), all keys
within the specified feature are included.}

\item{process_region}{A boolean flag; when set to `TRUE` (the default), special processing
is performed on the 'region' key (if present) to extract 'strand', 'start',
and 'end' information.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row corresponds to a feature from the input list.
        The data frame includes a 'cluster' column indicating the source gbk file.
}
\description{
This function processes a list of GeneBank features (loaded by read_gbk())
and converts selected features into a data frame. It supports processing
multiple gene clusters.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
gbk <- read_gbk("path/to/genebank_file.gbk")
df <- gbk_features_to_df(gbk)

# To extract only specific keys within the "CDS" feature
df <- gbk_features_to_df(gbk, feature = "CDS", keys = c("gene", "region"))

# To disable special processing of the 'region' key
df <- gbk_features_to_df(gbk, process_region = FALSE)
}
}
