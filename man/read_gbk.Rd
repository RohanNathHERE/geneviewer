\title{Read Data from GeneBank Files}
\usage{
read_gbk(path, sections = NULL, features = NULL, origin = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A string representing the file path to the target GeneBank (.gbk)
file or directory.}

\item{sections}{An optional vector of strings representing the names of specific sections
within the GeneBank file to extract (e.g., "LOCUS", "DEFINITION", "ACCESSION", "VERSION").
If `NULL` (the default), the function extracts all available sections.}

\item{features}{An optional vector of strings indicating specific feature types
to extract from the FEATURES section of the GeneBank file (e.g., "CDS", "gene", "mRNA").
If `NULL` (the default), the function extracts all feature types
present in the FEATURES section.}

\item{origin}{A boolean flag; when set to `TRUE` (the default), the origin
sequence data is included in the output.}
}
\value{
A list containing the contents of the specified sections and features of the GeneBank file.
        Each section and feature is returned as a separate list element.
}
\description{
This function reads data from GeneBank files. It allows selective extraction
of information by specifying sections and features.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read all data from a GeneBank file
gbk_data <- read_gbk("path/to/genebank_file.gbk")

# Read only specific sections from a GeneBank file
gbk_data <- read_gbk("path/to/genebank_file.gbk", sections = c("LOCUS", "DEFINITION"))

# Read specific features from the FEATURES section of a GeneBank file
gbk_data <- read_gbk("path/to/genebank_file.gbk", features = c("gene", "CDS"))

# Read data without the origin sequence
gbk_data <- read_gbk("path/to/genebank_file.gbk", origin = FALSE)
}
